# Expense Splitter

**Live Demo:** [https://expense-splitter-yje9.vercel.app/](https://expense-splitter-yje9.vercel.app/)

This web-app was inspired by my first experience sharing an apartment during the summer after my freshman year. It is a real-time expense tracking and splitting tool designed for off-campus college roommates to manage shared costs like toilet paper, WiFi, groceries, cleaning supplies, and utilities. Often, one or two roommates end up buying these items repeatedly, which can cause minor disagreements. This app ensures fair expense splits, keeps everyone accountable, and allows reimbursement unless someone chooses to forgive the debt.
