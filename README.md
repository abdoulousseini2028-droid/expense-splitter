# Expense Splitter

**Live Demo:** [https://expense-splitter-yje9.vercel.app/](https://expense-splitter-yje9.vercel.app/)

This web-app is born out of my first experience (summer of my freshman year of college) sharing an apartement with other people. This is a real-time expense tracking and splitting application built for off-campus college roommates who want to manage shared expenses like toilet paper, WiFi bills, groceries, cleaning supplies, and utilities. From experience, there's usually one or two person person out of all roommates who'll be buying those smalls things everytime they run out. However because of the small unnecessary fights it created in my case, I made this for fair splits to keep everyone accountable and reimburse anytime someone pays for everybody (unless they choose to forgive).
